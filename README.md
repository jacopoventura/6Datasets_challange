# 6Datasets_challange

In the given files "testData<X>" there are some columns. The column "t" indicates the target.

In this project, I build a model to predict "t" for the given data points.

In "testData6.csv" has no column "t" . It is necessary to find clusters and build a model which would be able to predict the cluster for new data points.
